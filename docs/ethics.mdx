## Overview

As robots become more capable and autonomous, ethical and safety considerations become paramount. This chapter explores the responsibilities of robot developers and the societal implications of physical AI.

### Key Ethical Principles

**1. Safety First**: Robots must not harm humans through action or inaction (Asimov's First Law).

**2. Transparency**: Decision-making processes should be understandable and auditable.

**3. Privacy**: Robots with sensors must respect personal data and privacy.

**4. Fairness**: Robots should not discriminate based on protected characteristics.

**5. Accountability**: Clear responsibility chain when robots cause harm.

### Safety Standards

**ISO 10218**: Industrial robot safety
- Risk assessment requirements
- Protective measures
- Emergency stop systems

**ISO 15066**: Collaborative robot safety
- Power and force limiting
- Safety-rated monitored stop
- Speed and separation monitoring

**ISO 13482**: Personal care robot safety
- Covers service robots in human environments
- Addresses physical and psychological safety

### Ethical Dilemmas

**Trolley Problem for Robots**: In unavoidable accident scenarios, how should robots decide who to protect?

**Job Displacement**: Automation may eliminate jobs—how do we ensure economic fairness?

**Privacy vs Security**: Surveillance robots improve safety but threaten privacy.

**Autonomy and Control**: How much autonomy should robots have? Who is liable for autonomous robot actions?

**Bias in AI**: Robot perception and decision-making may inherit biases from training data.

### Privacy Considerations

Robots with cameras, microphones, and sensors collect vast amounts of personal data:

**Best Practices:**
- **Data minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Encryption**: Secure data transmission and storage
- **Consent**: Inform users about data collection
- **Anonymization**: Remove personally identifiable information
- **Right to deletion**: Allow users to delete their data

## Summary

Ethics and safety are not afterthoughts but fundamental requirements for responsible robot development. Safety standards like ISO 15066 provide frameworks for human-robot collaboration. Privacy, transparency, fairness, and accountability must be designed into systems from the start. As robots become more autonomous, we must balance innovation with protection of human rights, safety, and dignity.
